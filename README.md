# MarIOGraphing
This package is intended to assist in graphing of data generated by the MarIO LUA script. 
Running the script produces data on the evolutionary progress and outputs progress in the form of generation, species, genome and fitness for each level played. The package includes functions that assit with visualizing the MarIo data.
